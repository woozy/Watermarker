# Watermarker - PHP script to apply watermarks

This script will apply the selected watermark to all the images in a folder. 

At the moment it corresponds to my imediate needs: the watermark must be in PNG format
and the destination images must be in JPG format. 

#TODO:
- Add opacity and padding to user args
- Detect image different immage formats
- Select single file
- Add new image prefix to [optional] user args
